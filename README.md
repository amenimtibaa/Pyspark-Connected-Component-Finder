This Notebook is the implementation of the proposed algorithm in : 
> Kardes, Hakan et al. “CCF: Fast and scalable connected component computation in MapReduce.” 2014 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC) (2014): 994-998.

* We used the Facebook Social circles dataset : https://snap.stanford.edu/data/egonets-Facebook.html

The purpose of the CCF algorithm here is to identify users’ social circles. In other words, find all the connected components in a given graph.
